"""
In probability theory and statistics, the binomial distribution 
with parameters n and p is the discrete probability distribution 
of the number of successes in a sequence of n independent experiments, 
each asking a yesâ€“no question, and each with its own Boolean-valued 
outcome: success or failure.

P(desired outcome) = p
p(alternative outcome) = p-1

p(y) = (Combintorix of p many times out of n) * p to the power of y 
* (1-p) to the power n -y
n = many trials
y = number of times we wish to happen
p = preferred outcome
